A pair of dumbbells, a barbell, a pair of kettlebells or a medicine ball. Since these workouts are full body workouts, it is best to have a rest day in between your work out days. Dumbbells typically offer a better range of motion than barbells, allowing you to build even more strength in the pectoral area. This will give your body enough rest to recover in between workouts.

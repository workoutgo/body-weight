<p>The evaluation of rate of force development during rapid contractions has recently become quite popular for characterising explosive strength of athletes, elderly individuals and patients. We know what moving a weight is done through the force that our muscles produce. In sports, especially basketball, the difference between winning and losing a play is milliseconds and inches.

Check out our editor’s choice for 2021. When pricing out nutrition bars, it’s more important to focus on the price per bar than the price of the whole box. 280 calories, 20 grams of protein, 20 grams of carb, four grams of fiber, 16 grams of fat, 1.5 grams of saturated fat and 13 grams of sugar. Fueling up a couple of hours before a workout calls for snack that&#39;s hearty enough to keep you full yet low enough in fat for easy digestion.

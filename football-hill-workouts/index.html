Pro Day / NFL Prep &#34; Corona Hill WORKOUT &#34; &#43; Ex TEXAS FOOTBALL Teammate From youtube.com

One of my favorite football linemen workouts is “king of the hill”.this is a drill that has become a huge motivational tool for correct blocking techniques. They are on offense two plays and defense two plays.

<p>I love that daily hiit workouts are over in 1/2 to 1/3 the time of p90x workouts. My first day of plyo x a few years ago i turned off the video after 15 minutes because i started getting really dizzy, laid. All of you know that i started p90x again last week, but only made it through half of the first few workouts because of pain in my hand, so i decided to restart the program yesterday and completely dedicate myself this time. The “chest &amp; back” regular in p90x consists mostly of different pushups and chinups, with 3 exercises that utilize free weights.</p>

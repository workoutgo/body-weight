For this drill you just need one barrel as well as the bit and reins that you normally make a run in. I rarely do it more than 10 or 15 minutes, and we’ll work on it before i go to the barrel pattern that day. I like to work my horse every day for the first eight weeks of training, and then decrease the training to four days a week. Ask your horse to move his shoulders over so he is pointed in a diagonal line to pole 1 at the second barrel.

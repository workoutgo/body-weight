At the heart of the 10 minute trainer is the super stacking. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen this advertised on tv because the infomercial is played at all times of the day and night. This time also includes a five to ten minute warm up and a five to ten minute cool down. There is the basic program where you do one disc a day, plus the ab ripper (it says to do the ab ripper two or three times a week, but in reality you can train your abs every day, as it is just 10 minutes a day).

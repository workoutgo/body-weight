<p>I intend on swapping out the yoga, plyo, and maybe kenpo of p90x with insanity. Most workouts last a full hour (yoga x is even longer at 92 minutes).

I was reading through some of the forums at beachbody and discovered that beachbody had a workout sheet that combined the two programs.</p>

After a few days i welcomed that familiar soreness back again. I don't think the cardio days in p90x are going to be enough after coming off an advenutre with shaun t so i wanted to incorporate some of the classic insanity workouts into it. For month 2, i’d keep the day 1 and 3 lift days the same, but i’d substitute the insanity upper body lifting for day 5 (as a sub for legs and back).
